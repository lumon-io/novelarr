   - Readarr integration
   - Jackett integration (torrents)
   - Prowlarr integration (unified indexers)
   - Searches all sources simultaneously

2. **Kavita Integration**
   - Checks if books exist in Kavita library
   - Shows "Available in Kavita" badge
   - "Open in Kavita" button for existing books
   - Authentication via API key

3. **Request Workflow**
   - Request books through Readarr
   - Readarr sync service monitors downloads
   - Automatic import to library when complete

4. **User Management**
   - Multi-user support
   - Role-based access (Admin/User)
   - Individual settings and preferences

5. **Admin Panel**
   - Configure all integrations
   - Manage users
   - Control request settings

## Current Architecture

```
User → Novelarr → Search (Readarr/Jackett/Prowlarr)
                → Check Kavita Library
                → Request via Readarr
                → Monitor Downloads
                → Import to Library
                → Read in Kavita
```

## Next Steps to Complete

### 1. Send to Kindle (Priority: HIGH)
- Add kindle_email field to user profiles
- Implement SMTP configuration
- Create conversion service (using Calibre)
- Add "Send to Kindle" button

### 2. Request Approval Workflow
- Admin approval queue
- Email notifications
- Request status tracking

### 3. Library Page
- Show all downloaded books
- Direct integration with Kavita library
- Reading progress sync

### 4. Enhanced Kavita Integration
- Sync reading progress
- Show series information
- Better library matching

## Testing the Current Build

1. **Start the container:**
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2. **Configure services in Settings:**
- Readarr URL & API key
- Jackett URL & API key (optional)
- Prowlarr URL & API key (optional)
- Kavita URL & API key

3. **Search for books:**
- Books in Kavita show "Available in Kavita"
- Books not in Kavita show "Request" button
- Jackett/Prowlarr results show "Manual Download Only"

4. **Request workflow:**
- Click "Request" on Readarr results
- Readarr adds the book and searches
- ReadarrSync monitors and imports completed downloads

## Configuration Needed

### Readarr
- URL: http://192.168.1.4:8787
- API Key: Your Readarr API key
- Quality Profile: 1 (default)
- Root Folder: /books

### Kavita
- URL: http://192.168.1.4:5000 (or your Kavita URL)
- API Key: Get from Kavita Settings → Security → API Keys

### Optional Services
- Jackett: For torrent searches
- Prowlarr: For unified indexer management

## Known Issues

1. **Prowlarr searches timeout** - Implemented 15s timeout wrapper
2. **Readarr mock data** - Returns mock Harry Potter books when API fails
3. **Book matching** - Kavita library matching could be improved

## Summary

Novelarr successfully acts as the "requesting side" of Kavita, providing:
- Unified search across multiple sources
- Integration with existing Kavita libraries
- Seamless request workflow through Readarr
- Multi-user support with individual settings

The main missing feature is **Send to Kindle** functionality, which would complete the user experience.
